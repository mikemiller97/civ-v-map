# Civ V Random Map Selector

I created this website because I was never fully satisfied with the random map selector available in the game. When using that, it only randomly picks between a few of the maps (Continents, Archipelago, Fractal, Pangea). This ignores most of the maps in the game and I wanted a way to be able to get those randomly selected as well.

All that is required to use the website is to hit the suggest map button and a random one will be selected for you. You can also change which DLCs you own so that if you do not own that DLC those maps will not get recommended to you.
